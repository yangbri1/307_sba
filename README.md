## To provide uniformity, every webpage stayed with a similar layout

## Each webpage has a gif on the very top of the page acting as an banner ad

## The Nav bar was constructed using Bootstrap library
### Although additional drop down menus, modal with a loading spinner element was my own twist to it

## Search bar centered in the middle next to a form dropdown selection for which categories is preferred by the user

## Onto the <header> tag, with the <h1> and <p> were centered using display:flex;
### Meanwhile the carousel was borrowed from Bootstrap shows a timed slideshow of different nature-related images
### Also the carousel would perform a spin animation whenever a mouse hovers over it

## Underneath shows a table with lorem ipsum's, thoretically explaining their past conditions, current evaluations, and future outlooks

## Next, there lies another form for the user if they are willing to sign up for a newsletter via email

## Additional information pertaining to the subject matter is laid out and hyperlink
## (so far attempted to attach as many "alt" and "title" attributes so it could be more accessible)

## Below is 1 same in-page anchor tag to redirect the user back to the top
### The other two gives the user a choice of picking either the Endangered Species or Invasive Species route

## Finally in the <footer>, there contains the socials and extra descriptions about the website
